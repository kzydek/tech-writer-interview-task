## What is GitHub?

In general, GitHub is a configuration management platform which, depending on its intended end user, serves for code, document or configuration file sharing, storing and management.  

GitHub is most often associated with developers and code which they can:
* collaboratively work on (developing most often its copy locally and contributing to the master repository later on)
* share (inviting also other developers to collaborate on building its perfect, functional shape by allowing their pull requests to be merged with the master branch)
* review (or peer review pull requests of others)
* control for versions (and changes, i.e. "_History_", "_Blame_" or "_Diffs_") 
* comment on (discuss the code, ask questions, basically use GitHub also as a communication platform)  

...to name only a few GitHub functions.  

Having more or less demonstrated in the previous paragraph (and proved that I have familiarized with) the general idea behind GitHub, its purpose, logic and [technicalities](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) I would also like to mention some benefits that GitHub can bring to its users, regardless of whether they are writers or developers (yet, assuming the perspective of a technical writer).  

Basically, GitHub:  

1. Allows to coordinate in one place huge projects which have multiple fathers or mothers (or "contributors" to use the official terminology).  

2. Is a platform which stores all versions, changes and modifications made to the content files, preventing situations when changes to documents are made anonymously or previous document versions are overwritten.  

3. Is a sort of a "progress tracking tool" not only in terms of the whole project in general but also with respect to your own work. Since all of the changes you have made on your piece of documentation are tracked you might use GitHub as a "motivational tool" to work on your files more often and contribute to them more regularly.  

4. Enables clear document revision path. You send a pull request, the owner is notified, the document is revised and feedback is provided. All of that in done and tracked in one place.  

5. Is simple in the context of the markdown language used. It allows a technical writer to focus more on the correctness and precision of content and message to be delivered rather than on formatting options, the multitude of which could easily distract a creative perfectionist from its main task.  

6. Last but not least, it can serve as a communication hub created for writers on writing, to which all can contribute by sharing useful ideas, links and documents.
