## What is GitHub?

In general, GitHub is a configuration management platform which, depending on its intended end user, serves for code, document or configuration file sharing, storing and management.  

GitHub is most often associated with developers and code which they can:
* collaboratively work on (developing most often its copy locally and contributing to the master repository later on)
* share (inviting also other developers to collaborate on building its perfect, functional shape by allowing their pull requests to be merged with the master branch)
* review (or peer review pull requests of others)
* control for versions (and changes, i.e. "_History_," "_Blame_" or "_Diffs_") 
* comment on (discuss the code, ask questions, basically use GitHub also as a communication platform)  

...to name only a few GitHub functions.  

Having more or less demonstrated in the previous paragraph (and proved that I have familiarized with) the general idea behind GitHub, its purpose, logic and [technicalities](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) I would also like to mention some benefits that GitHub can bring to its users, regardless of whether they are writers or developers (yet, assuming the perspective of a technical writer).  

Basically, GitHub:  

1. Allows to coordinate in one place huge projects which have multiple fathers or mothers (or "contributors" to use the official terminology).  

2. Is a platform which stores all versions, changes and modifications made to the content files, preventing situations when changes to documents are made anonymously or previous document versions are overwritten.  

3. Is a sort of a "progress tracking tool" not only in terms of the whole project in general but also with respect to your own work. Since all of the changes you have made on your piece of documentation are tracked you might use GitHub as a "motivational tool" to work on your files more often and contribute to them more regularly.  

4. Enables clear document revision path. You send a pull request, the owner is notified, the document is revised and feedback is provided. All of that in done and tracked in one place.  

5. Is simple in the context of the markdown language used. It allows a technical writer to focus more on the correctness and precision of content and message to be delivered rather than on formatting options, the multitude of which could easily distract a creative perfectionist from its main task.  

6. Last but not least, it can serve as a communication hub created for writers on writing, to which all can contribute by sharing useful ideas, links and documents.

## Sending a text message from a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy A5)  


### Introduction  

#### _Purpose_  

The purpose of this short work instruction is to provide users of Samsung Galaxy A5 with a step-by-step tutorial on how to easily send a text message from their smartphone to other mobile devices.  

#### _Basic information_  

* A text message, often called SMS (Short Message Service), is a simple and fast way of sending short piece of text information to someone else who is also using a mobile device.  
* You can attach emoticons or use letters with diacritics but you need to be aware that they may not be shown correctly on every device of the recipients.  
* The limit of characters that can be used in one text message is in general set to 160, including spaces. There is also a general restriction as to the overall number of 480 characters that a text message may contain. Text messages over 480 characters must be sent as MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service). When writing a text message that exceeds 480, you will be informed by a pop-up box that your message is being converted to multimedia message.  

	**Note**: Please take the above information into consideration regarding differences between SMS and MMS pricing, if applicable to you.  

#### _Prerequisites_  

In order to be able to send text messages to others, you will need to make sure that the SIM card is inserted into your smartphone.  


### Step-by-Step guide  

1. Press _**Home**_ key (at the bottom of the phone) to go to the main Menu where you will find _**Messages**_ icon.  

	**Note**: You can also access _**Messages**_ by tapping Apps icon on the Home screen.

### Troubleshooting tips  

#### _1. “Invalid recipient”_  

It might happen that you receive “Invalid recipient” message when entering first letters of a person you have on your contact list.  

![T1](https://i.imgur.com/ygoofaN.png)  

The reason for it is that you have not tapped the contact displayed as a hint. Remove the entered recipient and try again (please refer to step 4 of the **Step-by-step guide** for reference).  


#### _2. “Add recipients”_  

If you happen to try to send a text message without selecting the recipient first, you will be prompted to “Add recipients” (please refer to step 4 of the **Step-by-step guide** for reference).

**Note**: In case of any other problems or questions, please refer to the following [site](http://deviceguides.vodafone.ie/web/samsung-galaxy-a5/troubleshooting/text-messaging) or contact [Technical Support](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/).  


### Use Cases  

#### _1. “Sending text message to multiple recipients”_  

You can select multiple recipients of your text message from your contact list in an exactly the same way as you select one, simply by repeating the steps. If you enter phone numbers however instead of choosing recipient from the contact list, make sure you separate the numbers with a _**comma**_ or a _**semicolon**_.
